    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]) is an
      arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant
      representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living
      relatives are the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae.[4]. The
      koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern
      regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South
      Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large
      head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a
      body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Pelage
      colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern
      populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their
      counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate
      subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>
    <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these
      trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited
      nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up
      to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only
      between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud
      bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence
      with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials,
      koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers'
      pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives.
      These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old.
      Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by
      various pathogens, such as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydiaceae" target="_blank">Chlamydiaceae</a>
      bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.</p>
    <p id="underneath-img">Koalas were hunted by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" target="_blank">Indigenous Australians</a>
      and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded
      encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the
      animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert
      Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in
      1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist
      John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to
      the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology
      were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because
      of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a
      symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" target="_blank">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>.
      [1] The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in
      Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable.[5] The animal was hunted
      heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings
      in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to
      protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation
      efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented
      or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction
      caused by agriculture and urbanisation.</p>

    <p>The koala's geographic range covers roughly 1,000,000 km2
      (390,000 sq mi), and 30 ecoregions.[50] It extends throughout eastern and
      southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and
      southeastern Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and
      southeastern South Australia. The koala was introduced near Adelaide and
      on several islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island.[1] The
      population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its
      range.[50] Fossil evidence shows that the koala's range stretched as far
      west as southwestern Western Australia during the late Pleistocene. They
      were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes
      and hunting by indigenous Australians.[51]</p>

      <p id="left-column">Because they get so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit

        and sleep 20 hours a day;[61] only 4 hours a day are
        spent in active movement.[62] They are predominantly active at night and
        spend most of their waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in
        the same tree, possibly for as long as a day.[63]</p>
      <p id="right-column">On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree
        which is cooler than the surrounding air. The koala

        the tree to lose
        heat without panting.[64][65] On warm days, a koala may rest with its back
        against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs
        dangling.[61] During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball
        to conserve energy.[63] On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker
        branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree,
        the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all
        fours.[61] The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but
        sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.[66]</p>

    <p>Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the
      <span class="highlight">poverty</span> brought about by the drought of
      1926–28 led to the

      one-month open season in August 1927.[157] In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the
      Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had
      been brought to <span class="highlight">near extinction</span> in that
      state, suggesting that only 500–1000 remained.[158][159]</p>
