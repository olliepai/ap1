	<!-- ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS COMMENT...
			this isn't a requirement, just pointing out that the stuff below is
			simply directions and that you will only need to interact with the
			contents of this file from this point on.
		-->

	<h2>Directions</h2>

	<p>
		When the "Check Email" button is clicked, your code should check to
		see if the text entered in the text area is in fact a validly
		formatted email address (just the format...you aren't checking to
		see if the email address is a real address). For our purposes, any
		string formatted in the following fashion will be considered a valid
		format (this is a simplified version of the actual standard):
		<br>
		<em style="margin-left:30px"><strong>blah@foo.meh</strong></em>
	</p>

	<p>
		<dt><strong>blah</strong></dt>
		<dd>one or more characters that do not contain an @ symbol</dd>
		<br>
		<dt><strong>@</strong></dt>
		<dd>The email must contain one @ symbol only. To the left of the @,
			there must be at least one character (the blah). To the right, there
			must be at least three characters (a foo, followed by a ., followed
			by a meh).</dd>
		<br>
		<dt><strong>foo</strong></dt>
		<dd>one or more characters that do not contain an @ symbol</dd>
		<br>
		<dt><strong>.</strong></dt>
		<dd>After the @ symbol, there must be a . symbol. The . symbol must
			have at least one character on either side of it (ignoring the blah@ part).
		</dd>
		<br>
		<dt><strong>meh</strong></dt>
		<dd>one or more characters where neither an @ or . symbol are allowed</dd>
	</p>

	<p>
		You should use the &lt;p&gt; tag near the top of this file (with an id of
		"validationMessage") to report the results to the user. A valid format
		should simply get a "valid" message while an invalid format should
		get a "not quite as valid...try again" message. Notice that I have
		created stub Javascript functions for you and hooked them up to the
		relevant inputs (I even put a "clear" function that empties the text
		field...which works in this case but would be awful in other cases).
	</p>

	<h2>Examples of invalid emails</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>blah@boo@some.net</strong> has too many @s</li>
		<li><strong>blah@boo</strong> has no . after the @</li>
		<li><strong>blah@boo.</strong> has nothing after the .</li>
		<li><strong>blah@.boo</strong> has nothing between the . and the @</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>This is a valid email!</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>blah.boo@some.happy.bar</strong>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can have many dots in the address as long as there is at least one dot after the @ and there is at least one character between the @ and the first post-@ dot and at least one character after the final dot.</li>
	</p>
